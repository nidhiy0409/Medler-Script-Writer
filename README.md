# Java Swing Text Editor with Syntax Highlighting

The **Java Swing Text Editor with Syntax Highlighting** is a versatile and user-friendly Java application that provides a text editing environment with enhanced features. Developed using Java's Swing library, the application offers a graphical user interface (GUI) for creating, editing, and saving text documents. It introduces syntax highlighting, allowing users to work with code more efficiently, and offers a dual-theme interface for a personalized working experience.

## Features

- **Syntax Highlighting:** The text editor incorporates a sophisticated syntax highlighting mechanism. It intelligently identifies and differentiates between keywords, strings, and comments within the text content. This feature significantly enhances code readability and reduces errors by visually segregating distinct code elements.

- **Dual-Theme Interface:** The application offers both light and dark mode themes, catering to users' preferences and varying lighting conditions. The light mode provides a clean and familiar appearance, while the dark mode minimizes eye strain during extended coding sessions.

- **File Management:** Users can effortlessly create new text documents, open existing ones, and save their work to a desired location on their system. The intuitive menu-based user interface ensures that users can manage their documents efficiently.

- **Highlighting Selected Text:** To draw attention to specific sections of the text, the application includes a "Highlight" button. Users can select text and click this button to apply a yellow background highlight, aiding in visual distinction.
